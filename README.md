I am a penetration tester and security engineer with a passion for cybersecurity. In this GitHub, I have a collection of some of my work including security notes, penetration testing tools, writeups, miscellaneous scripts, and data related to my YouTube videos. I have extensive experience in Python, and have created many scripts and penetration testing tools to automate or speed up common tasks.
